# How to start the websites
1. Download all the files in this folder onto your computer.
2. Enter `$> docker-compose up`, then the websites are ready. 
3. Add these lines in the `/etc/hosts` file<br>
`10.9.0.5    www.bank32.com` <br>
`10.9.0.5    www.bank99.com` <br>
4. Now you can access websites via names. <br>
Special gratitude to Dr. Du at the Syracuse University for providing this code.
