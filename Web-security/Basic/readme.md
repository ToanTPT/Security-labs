***How to start the websites***<br>
Download all files in this folder onto your computer <br>
Enter `$> docker-compose up` then the servers are ready <br>
Add these lines in the `/etc/hosts` file <br>
`10.9.0.5    www.bank32.com` <br>
`10.9.0.5    www.bank99.com` <br>
Now you can access websites via names
Special gratitude to Dr.Du at the Syracuse University for this code.
